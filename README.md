> "I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess"

Tells you some of what you're doing wrong as a [Bolt to the Heart
sword weaver](https://snowcrows.com/raids/elementalist/weaver/sword/),
[Axe Mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/), or
[Power Daredevil](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/daredevil/power/).
This is pre-alpha code guaranteed to contain more bugs than all of Maguuma.

## Usage

- [Go to the site](https://hobinjk.github.io/moxie/dist/)
- Click upload
- Select EVTC file of a benchmark attempt on local hardrive
- Wait for parsing
- Cry

Optionally upload a gameplay video so you can see your mistakes in glorious
360p. At least I recommend scaling down your video because I didn't optimize
anything anywhere. If you select an Elite Insights HTML file moxie will try to
parse it but half the buffs are missing so it won't be able to yell at you as
much as you deserve.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Elite
Insights](https://github.com/baaron4/GW2-Elite-Insights-Parser) for being an
awesome EVTC parser, [arcdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) for
generating the EVTC and having comprehensive documentation, and Kompa for
giving me log files of good weaver
gameplay because otherwise I wouldn't know what it looks like.
